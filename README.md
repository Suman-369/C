# Simple Chatbot using Socket.io & React

This project is a simple chatbot application built with **React** for the frontend and **Socket.io** for real-time communication between the client and the server. The chatbot allows users to send and receive messages instantly, simulating a real-time chat experience.

## Features

- Real-time messaging using Socket.io
- Interactive chat interface built with React
- Simple and clean UI
- Easy to set up and run locally

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the backend/chat server)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-chatbot-socketio-react.git
    cd simple-chatbot-socketio-react
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    - For the server:
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm install
        ```
    - For the client:
        ```bash
        cd ../client
        npm install
        ```

3. **Start the server**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```

4. **Start the client**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to use the chatbot.

## Project Structure

```
simple-chatbot-socketio-react/
│
├── client/      # React frontend
└── server/      # Node.js backend with Socket.io
```

## How It Works

- The React frontend connects to the Node.js backend using Socket.io.
- When a user sends a message through the chat UI, the message is transmitted to the server via a Socket.io event.
- The server processes the message and can respond with a bot reply, which is then sent back to the client and displayed in the chat window.
- All communication is handled in real-time, providing an instant chat experience.

## Customization

- You can enhance the bot logic on the server to provide smarter or more interactive responses.
- Style the chat interface in the client for a better user experience.
